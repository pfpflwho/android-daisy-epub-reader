# Introduction #
DAISY is an acronym: Digital Accessible Information SYstem. This mouthful represents several related things:
  * A type of eBook typically used by people who have trouble reading other forms of books, particularly print books.
  * The type actually includes a range of books which may include pre-recorded audio, text, images, and so on. And there are 2 current versions of DAISY books:
    * version 2.02 which is the current version used globally by virtually every country, except the USA
    * version 3 which is used predominantly in the USA.

The DAISY 3 books in the USA seldom include pre-recorded audio so the phone would need to synthesise the audio from the text.

Many DAISY books are restricted to people who have a registered, related impairment, for instance dyslexia or severe visual impairments, including full blindness _and_ where the individual is a resident of the particular country where the book is located. There are probably millions of DAISY books globally.

Thankfully there are some sample DAISY books available online, the [SampleDAISYBooks](SampleDAISYBooks.md) wiki page has links to some sources of sample DAISY books.

# Out of scope #
http://www.daisy.org/projects/daisy-online-delivery/drafts/20100218/do-spec-20100218.html contains the specifications for Daisy Online Delivery Protocol. We don't expect to support this protocol yet, until after we have all the basics for the core product working, however at some point it'd be good to add support for online delivery of DAISY content.
