# Introduction #

Android development can take some time to learn, especially as you probably need to install various additional tools, including the Eclipse IDE, the Android ADT plug-in to Eclipse, the Oracle (ex Sun) JDK, etc. The following link may help you get started. http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

You will also need to install subversion (see http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html ) to download the code for the project (which you can then 'import' into Eclipse). See http://code.google.com/p/android-daisy-epub-reader/source/checkout to get the code.

I'd then recommend experimenting with some of the Android tutorials (linked at the end of the Android SDK installing page) to get a feel for some of the basics of developing Android applications.

# Contributing Code #
In terms of you making code contributions, we can start with you sending your changes to me, then we can consider adding you as a 'committer' once you're comfortable and confident working with the code. There are various ways you can send me code; 'patch files' using the subversion 'diff' command are a good start. These can be attached to issues on the site or emailed directly to me.

# Emulators and Phones to develop, test and debug #
The emulator can be very very slow, from time to time it seems to be buggy too :( Also it takes some practice to get used to using it e.g. to create an AVD (Android Virtual Device). I suggest you create one with a small screen (QVGA) and one with a larger screen so you can experiment with running the software in both. If you have an Android phone you can use it to run and debug your work. Try connecting it over an USB cable. Depending on your operating system (Windows is the most challenging) you may need to install software drivers. You will also need to enable USB debugging in the settings on your Android phone and enable non-market applications.
