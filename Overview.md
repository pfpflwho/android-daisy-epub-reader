# Introduction #

Several groups and communities would like a free DAISY reader for the Android platform. Gary and Julian met for the first time at the RNIB Techshare conference in September 2009 and decided to work together to create an open-source project for a DAISY reader. Gary's previous experience of writing a DAISY reader for another mobile phone platform in python was combined with Julian's involvement with: Android, the [eyes-free project](http://code.google.com/p/eyes-free), and his work at Google. This project is the result of our work.

We have decided to release early and often so the early versions of the software are basic and flawed. We expect the application to mature in the coming weeks and months. While we make no commitments at this stage we would like to support several formats of DAISY (202 and version 3), and epubs.

We value your input, both in terms of feedback and for the more technical - code.

# Minimum requirements #

The application relies on Android devices that have version 1.6 (also known as 'donut') or later installed. The installation of the apk will fail abruptly on earlier versions of Android. You can check the version of the Android platform from Settings > About phone > Firmware version. 1.6 or later should be fine.

The DAISY content should be copied into one or more folders on the memory card on the phone (often known as the SDCARD) as they're generally quite large files.
