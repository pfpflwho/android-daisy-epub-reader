# Introduction #
Here are some links and references to sample DAISY books. As this program effectively 'plays' full audio books, you will want to download full audio books, rather than books that consist of text. Books containing text need to be processed by speech synthesis software, this software doesn't currently provide this capability.

Note: of the 100,000's of DAISY full audio books that exist, many of them are restricted to registered subscribers (who have recognised relevant impairments e.g. dyslexia or visual impairment). Also the subscriptions are often limited citizens of a particular country for example Spanish citizens for ONCE (http://www.once.es/); which makes samples hard to obtain for general readers.

# Samples #
## Sample DAISY 2.02 books ##
Sample DAISY 2.02 books in various forms are available. You will need the full-audio books to listen to them in our current software. Other formats, such as full-text book are not supported (yet).

Here is a link to the first suitable book, called FireSafety, to save you time http://www.daisy.org/sample-content/#t9

http://www.nfb.org/nfb/braille_monitor.asp#Online%20Access is the Braille Monitor magazine from the NFB. Each issue is available as a full audio DAISY book. They appear to be published in the DAISY 2.02 version.

I suggest you try the following book http://www.guidedogswa.org/books/scriptures/bible/niv/niv_nt-202.zip It's one of the smaller full-audio DAISY 2.02 books, but downloading about 270 mega-bytes may still be time-consuming or impractical depending on the cost, speed and quality of your internet connection.

Some of their books are provided in a format suitable for creating CD-ROMs, called an ISO file (as indicated by the end of the filename in the URL address of .iso) These files would need an additional step (to either create a pyhsical CD-ROM or 'mount' the CD image file) which I have not described on this wiki page. I suggest you search online using a search engine for advice on how to create CDs from an ISO file, or how to mount these files so the contents can be read by your computer e.g. to enable you to process the zip file.

## What to do with the sample books ##
### Step 1 - download the sample book ###
Currently you need to download the sample (full-audio) DAISY 2.02 books onto your computer. The sample files are typically compressed into a single zip file. Zip files are extremely popular in the computer world and many utilities are available to process them and extract the compressed files.

### Step 2 - unpack the compressed files ###
Use an unzip program, or if you have recent versions of Microsoft Windows, etc. then the Windows Explorer program has built-in capabilities to extract the files from the zip file.

I suggest you create a folder called DAISY202Books and extract each zip file into a separate, memorable sub-folder. Some of the zip files will effectively already include a reasonably sensible folder name e.g. FireSafety for the book of the same title from daisy.org.

Each Daisy book needs to be in a separate, distinct folder in order for players to be able to process and play them correctly.

### Step 3 - copy the uncompressed files onto the phone's memory card ###
There are several ways to copy the files. You choices also depend on your technical abilities to install development software from the main Android project.

#### Copying the files using hardware ####
Typically the memory cards in Android phones are in the Micro SD format, tiny, thin rectangular items about 1/4" in size (8 mm). Some of these are provided with an adapter which converts these micro cards into the SD Card format (about 5/8" or 15mm). Many laptops now have a suitable slot that accepts this SD format. Otherwise you can procure a USB adapter that will accept the Micro SD cards (or whatever format your Android device uses).
  * Tip: You can use your existing memory card from your Android device if you wish, and if it has sufficient space (see next section). You will need to discover where the memory card is, and discover how to remove it safely. Ask for help from a computer-literate friend if you get stuck or frustrated.

Essentially you'll need to copy the sub-folders containing the uncompressed files for each DAISY book onto a suitable memory card for your phone. As DAISY books vary in size from 10's of mega-bytes to 100's of mega-bytes, Consider using a memory card with at least 2 giga-bytes available.
  * Tip: use a folder name on the memory card that matches the name you have for your library of books on your computer e.g. DAISY202Books to make your books easier to find.

Once the files have been copied to the memory card, eject the card using the features of your computer's operating system. I can't hope to tell you the myriad details of how to do so here... Ejecting the card reduces the chances of corrupting the copy of the book.

Now the memory card needs to be inserted into your Android device. This can be fiddly depending on the model of the device e.g. some even need the cover and battery to be removed as part of the process. Ask for help from a computer-literate friend if you get stuck or frustrated. If there's an existing card, remove it first. Take care of it as it may already have other files you care about, such as photos.

#### Copying the files using software ####
Many Android phones come with utility software from the manufacturer that can be installed on your personal computer. This software typically includes some sort of file transfer software. If they provide software for the operating system on your personal computer, you may choose to install it and use it to transfer files, typically using a USB cable provided with the phone.

Once you manage to install this software, you should be able to copy the DAISY2.02Books folder from your computer to the memory card of your Android phone.

If you can't find suitable software to install on your personal computer, you can use the development toolkit as a last resort. The software is available for the 3 main operating systems here  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Follow the instructions on that web page, etc. to install the software.

### Parting advice on copying books ###
There are many things that make the instructions hard to document adequately, to cope with your combination of phone, operating system, technology, etc. There are also other ways of transferring the files. These instructions are intended to provide a fairly detailed overview for fairly technical users. I couldn't hope to cover all the permutations and situations users will encounter. Finding a technophile who is willing to help you is likely to make the process much more reliable and speedier.

In the meantime we will work to reduce the number of steps required, by adding support for zipped books directly into the software.

## Sample DAISY 3 books ##
The new version of our software supports full audio DAISY 3 books. These are rare, at least we haven't found many online.

Sample DAISY 3 books are available from

We are about to add support to read aloud full-text books, where sites such as the following may be useful:

http://www.munseys.com seems to have about 30,000 free books in DAISY format. These books are full text books in DAISY 3 format.

### Commercial sources of DAISY books ###
http://www.readhowyouwant.com/braille/ provide books in various formats including DAISY 2.02 and DAISY 3 as far as I can tell. The books are relatively expensive e.g. $9.99
