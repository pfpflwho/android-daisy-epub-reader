# Introduction #
Some of you receive your DAISY books from Bookshare, in the USA. This DAISY Player software does not support the format of their books yet. Their books are created as full-text books in the DAISY 3 format.

Here is some information to help you find a suitable player until this player can support full-text DAISY 3 books.

# Details #

Books from bookshare are not compatible with the current version of the DaisyReader project. Their books are in the newer DAISY 3 standard and provided as full-text books. This player supports the older DAISY 2.02 format which is still widely used globally. Note: Books in the USA tend to be full-text and in DAISY 3 format.

There is another reader that might suit you better. It includes modifications made by the bookshare team to enable the reader to 'read' their books. The reader is called FBReaderJ. The following web page provides lots of background on the project and includes some links to where the software is located http://www.apps4android.org/?p=2159

We have started adding support for full-text books and for DAISY 3 books. The work is taking much longer than I'd hoped. Contributions of code are welcome.
