Here's our second Beta of the new DaisyReader App which is currently a featured download on this homepage, and also available in the Downloads section of this project site. We have added support for DAISY 3 full audio books to the app and made other tweaks and improvements to the app. We know there are some weaknesses in the app which is why it's still called an Unstable Beta.

The name DaisyReaderUnstableBeta005.apk reflects the fourth project sprint we've completed on the new app.

About this project
This is a collaborative project to create an open-source electronic book reader that will support various formats including DAISY and epub content. Currently the software is supports DAISY 2.02 and DAISY 3 formats of 'Talking Books', thankfully there are 100,000's of these books available from various sources, particularly in Europe.

The new application requires version 2.2 of Android, or higher. The old application requires a minimum of version 1.5 of Android (also known as 'cupcake'). When the application is installed on a device with version 1.6 or later with TalkBack installed, the navigation of files and folders on the sdcard is spoken.

The application can be downloaded from the Downloads section of this project, here http://code.google.com/p/android-daisy-epub-reader/downloads/list


The old DaisyReader application includes support for various languages, unlike the new app which is currently limited to English, Korean and Vietnamese. So, if you would still like the old app, please download the latest version (currently release 483) unless you have serious problems using it. This includes support for books in encodings such as Windows 1252, ISO-8859-1 as well as the default UTF-8 encoding. Books in Windows 1252 encoding include books from the Norwegian Library. Books in ISO-8859-1 encoding include books from Spain's ONCE organisation. You can try an older version if you cannot use the current version.
