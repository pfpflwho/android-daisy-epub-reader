# Introduction #
We are assembling a list of resources that help people to create books in DAISY formats. The project team need to generate sample books for testing and you may also wish to create books in this format.

We have also used excellent commercial software from Dolphin Computers to create DAISY 2.02 books. Several of these books are currently available in the Downloads area of this project.
